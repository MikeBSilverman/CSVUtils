# How to contribute
I'm thankful to have your help, and to help others facing similar problems.

## Testing
- CPPCheck for style/coding issues  
- Zero warnings from msbuild  
- Could honestly use more

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).  
Please try to have all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Submitting ideas
Put them in the issue tracker in the GitHub project.

Thanks,
Mike
